#+TITLE:stdlambda—Standard Library for Lamdba Calculus

Lambda Calculus is an inspiring idea, but most of the resources about
it list just a couple of utilities and ways to encode data, without
getting deep enough into building a _practical_ set of
primitives. ~stdlambda~ tries to do just that: provide a more or less
practical set of primitives for programming in Lambda
Calculus. Included are:
- Frequent combinators like ~S~, ~K~, ~I~, and ~Y~.
- Church Booleans and all the possible logical operations on them.
- Church Numerals and arithmetics on them.
  - List-encoded numerals might be provided in the future.
- Church Pairs (with an opinionated ~nil = false~) and Haskell/Lisp-inspired utilities on them.
  - nil = ~λx.true~ pairs might be provided in the future.

Sources of inspiration and code:
- [[http://www.golfscript.com/lam/][Universal Lambda page]].
- Justine Tunney's [[https://justine.lol/lambda/][SectorLambda page]].
- Hikaru Ikuta's [[https://github.com/woodrush/lambdacraft][Lambdacraft]]

* Getting Started

- Feed the definitions from provided files into your Lambda Calculus
  interpreter. The files (and their interdependencies) are:
  - ~combinators.lambda~ :: Logical combinators, no deps.
  - ~bool.lambda~ :: Boolean ops, no deps.
  - ~numbers.lambda~ :: Numeric, arithmetics. Depends on ~combinators.lambda~ and ~bool.lambda~.
  - ~cons.lambda~ :: Linked lists and utils for them. Depends on combinators.lambda and bool.lambda
  - ~alias.lambda~ :: Aliases for all of the above.
- Run the code using these primitives. Say
#+begin_src lisp
  fac = Y λr.λn.(if (=0 n) 1 (× n (r (1- n))))
  (fac 5)
#+end_src

* Plans:
- Justine's functions (justine.txt)
- Functions from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.19.0.0/docs/Data-List.html:
  - ~last~ + ~init~
  - ~foldl~?
  - ~scan~
  - ~repeat~, ~replicate~
  - ~take~, ~drop~, ~splitAt~
  - ~span~, ~break~
  - ~isPrefixOf~, ~isSuffixOf~, ~isInfixOf~, ~isSubsequenceOf~
  - ~find~
- SRFI 1:
  - ~c(a|d)+r~
  - ~first~ etc
  - ~delete~
  - ~copy~
  - ~list-eq~
  - ~(un)zip~
  - ~count~
  - ~partition~
- Associative lists
- Strings (use cons?)
- Set operations (use cons?)
 - ~lset<=~
 - ~lset=~
 - ~lset-adjoin~
 - ~lset-union~
 - ~lset-intersection~
 - ~lset-difference~
 - ~lset-xor~
 - ~lset-diff+intersection~
 - ~lset-union!~
 - ~lset-intersection!~
 - ~lset-difference!~
 - ~lset-xor!~
 - ~lset-diff+intersection!~
- Merge sort?
- Arithmetic operators like +, -, / etc. as aliases for respective functions.
