#+TITLE:stdlambda—Standard Library for Lamdba Calculus

Lambda Calculus is an inspiring idea, but most of the resources about
it list just a couple of utilities and ways to encode data, without
getting deep enough into building a _practical_ set of
primitives. ~stdlambda~ tries to do just that: provide a more or less
practical set of primitives for programming in Lambda
Calculus. Included are:
- Frequent combinators like ~S~, ~K~, ~I~, and ~Y~.
- Church Booleans and all the possible logical operations on them.
- Church Numerals and arithmetics on them.
  - List-encoded numerals might be provided in the future.
- Church Pairs (with an opinionated ~nil = false~) and Haskell/Lisp-inspired utilities on them.
  - nil = ~λx.true~ pairs might be provided in the future.

Sources of inspiration and code:
- [[http://www.golfscript.com/lam/][Universal Lambda page]].
- Justine Tunney's [[https://justine.lol/lambda/][SectorLambda page]].
- Hikaru Ikuta's [[https://github.com/woodrush/lambdacraft][Lambdacraft]]

* Getting Started

- Feed the definitions from provided files into your Lambda Calculus
  interpreter. The load order and dependencies of files are:
  - combinators.lambda (no deps)
  - bool.lambda (no deps)
  - numbers.lambda (depends on combinators.lambda and bool.lambda)
  - cons.lambda (depends on combinators.lambda and bool.lambda)
- Run the code using these primitives. Say
#+begin_src lisp
  fac = Y λr.λn.(if (zerop n) 1 (mult n (r (pred n))))
  (fac 5)
#+end_src


* Plans:
- Justine's functions
- Functions from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.19.0.0/docs/Data-List.html:
  - last + init
  - foldl?
  - scan
  - repeat, replicate
  - take, drop, splitAt
  - span, break
  - isPrefixOf, isSuffixOf, isInfixOf, isSubsequenceOf
  - find
- SRFI 1:
  - c(a|d)+r
  - first etc
  - delete
  - copy
  - list-eq
  - (un)zip
  - count
  - partition
- Associative lists
- Strings (use cons?)
- Set operations (use cons?)
 - lset<=
 - lset=
 - lset-adjoin
 - lset-union
 - lset-intersection
 - lset-difference
 - lset-xor
 - lset-diff+intersection
 - lset-union!
 - lset-intersection!
 - lset-difference!
 - lset-xor!
 - lset-diff+intersection!
- Merge sort?
- Arithmetic operators like +, -, / etc. as aliases for respective functions.
